Move the mouse while holding LMB to rotate the camera;
Press 1 to launch a polyhedron;
Move the mouse while holding RMB to set the position of the AABB AABB query;
Move the mouse to set the ray-cast ray position;
Press LMB in a ray-casted object to apply a force of 10 joules on it;
Press BACKSPACE to exit the application;
